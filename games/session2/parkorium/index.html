      <p>For my game I designed it to sort of be a slightly challenging game in which your goal is to figure out your way to one of the Gems while discovering the mechanics on your own. I have a vaporwave type background and I tried my best to have the asset colors match said background. The main mechanics are sliding, jumping, and movement. These skills will help you get to the gem and finish the level. I tried my best to keep the design as minimalistic as possible so that there wasnâ€™t anything graphically that looks incredibly off. The game will probably take the player anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes to complete depending on their skill level. When you do get to one of the gems the game restarts including the soundtrack.
