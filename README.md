## Session 2 Projects

+ [**Apocalypse**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/apocalypse/)
  - **Created by:** Mason and Justin
  - **Description:** A tower defense game in which you defend against a wave of aliens.
  
+ [**Castle Defender**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/castle_defender/)
  - **Created by:** Anthony and Daniel
  - **Description:** You are a king and you must protect your castle from intruders. You can deploy mages and knights to win the battle. You will be attacked by dragons and mystical creatures. Once you win the war you can roam free in the Sandbox.
  
+ [**Dungeon Puzzle**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/dungeon_puzzle/dungeon_puzzle/)
  - **Created by:** Wilbert, Jiatong, and Lucas
  - **Description:** Separated into different rooms, two wizards move in synchrony to escape a dungeon. Using their unique abilities and keen intellect, the wizards solve the increasingly difficult puzzles as they progress through the dungeon. The dungeon will be split up into worlds that each introduce new mechanics and allow the player to master them.
  
+ [**Escort**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/escort/escort/)
  - **Created by:** Franklin, Gavin, Muneer, and William
  - **Description:** You are a robot babysitting the family baby when suddenly your house is raided.  Your job is to safely escort the baby out of the house and kill all the enemies.  Our game is a top down shooter where you have to travel through a house and kill enemies and protect the baby. The baby is randomly wandering around but you can push it to influence its movement.  Escort the baby safely out the house to win.
  - **Tutorial:** Move using WASD and use your mouse to aim.  Use QEF to shoot and “space” to discard your weapon and select a new one.  Upon picking your weapon, the gun will automatically shoot at your mouse. 

  
+ [**Odysseus In Underworld**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/odysseus_in_underworld/)
  - **Created by:** Dani and Manav
  - **Description:** Our game is an endless 3D running game starring Odysseus, the main character of our narrative. The player (Odysseus) is running through the Underworld while being chased by ghosts.  Odysseus will run through different parts of the Underworld, containing different terrains.  We added  facts about Odysseus and his actual trip to the Underworld to teach the player. As the player progresses Odysseus will run faster, making the pace of the game increase. There will also be more obstacles. 
	This game requires the player to master the skills of jumping. Especially as the speed of the game increases, it will be more difficult for the player to survive. The goal of the game is to return home, though it will be impossible in our game (because it is endless).

  
+ [**Parkorium**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/parkorium/)
  - **Created by:** Liam
  - **Description:** For my game I designed it to sort of be a slightly challenging game in which your goal is to figure out your way to one of the Gems while discovering the mechanics on your own. I have a vaporwave type background and I tried my best to have the asset colors match said background. The main mechanics are sliding, jumping, and movement. These skills will help you get to the gem and finish the level. I tried my best to keep the design as minimalistic as possible so that there wasn't anything graphically that looks incredibly off. The game will probably take the player anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes to complete depending on their skill level. When you do get to one of the gems the game restarts including the soundtrack.

## Session 3 Projects

+ [**Courier**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session3/courier/)
  - **Created by:** Taylor and Leo
  - **Description:** A man wakes up in a mysterious lab with nothing but the crate on his back, his trusty crowbar, and the motivation of a box of his favorite cookies at the end of the maze. Can he make it through all the perilous trials of the lab?
  
+ [**Demonic Destruction**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session3/demonicdestruction/)
  - **Created by:** Wilson, Harrison, and Rose
  - **Description:** You have been sent to the Demon realm in order to cull the Demon population, under the pretense that this would protect the rest of existence from the Apocalypse. But is this actually true?
  
+ [**Factory Jumper**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session3/factoryjumper/)
  - **Created by:** Daniel and Ian
  - **Description:** Factory Jumper is a game where you enter an old factory that suddenly comes back to life. You have to dodge moving pistons as well as use conveyors to navigate your way out.
  
+ [**Neko Neko Ni**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session3/nekonekoni/)
  - **Created by:** Danika and Silvia
  - **Description:** You are a cat left alone at your house and an army of mice try to ruin the house. You must defend your house by killing all the mice in each room.

  - **Tutorial:** Use the arrow keys to move left and right, use the space bar to jump, and use the S key to swat at enemies.

+ [**Too Far Gone**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session3/toofargone/)
  - **Created by:** Brendan, Sam, and Cary
  - **Description:** Too Far Gone is a platformer adventure game about Dexter, an astronaut who got sucked through a wormhole, and is lost on an alien planet, who is trying to venture around the planet and reach his damaged ship in under 3 days time, before the wormhole closes.
  
+ [**Tree**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session3/tree/)
  - **Created by:** Allan, Andy, and William
  - **Description:** Game starts in a small village, with one quiet main character. Leaving his home, he hears a sound to the left of him (rather than the widely accepted rightward progression), in the forest. He grabs a stick and runs in. Mostly inspired by the 2D sections of Link’s Awakening and Megaman, the game will be centered around platforming, puzzles, and combat. There will be two more unlockable characters, the shooter character, and the spell caster character. Both are able to solve new types of puzzles and aid in certain combat matchups.
