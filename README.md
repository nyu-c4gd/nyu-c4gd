## Session 2 Projects

+ [**Apocalypse**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/)
  - **Created by:** Mason and Justin
  - **Description:** A tower defense game in which you defend against a wave of aliens.
  
+ [**Castle Defender**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/castle_defender/)
  - **Created by:** Anthony and Daniel
  - **Description:** You are a king and you must protect your castle from intruders. You can deploy mages and knights to win the battle. You will be attacked by dragons and mystical creatures. Once you win the war you can roam free in the Sandbox.
  
+ [**Dungeon Puzzle**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/dungeon_puzzle/)
  - **Created by:** Wilbert, Jiatong, and Lucas
  - **Description:** Separated into different rooms, two wizards move in synchrony to escape a dungeon. Using their unique abilities and keen intellect, the wizards solve the increasingly difficult puzzles as they progress through the dungeon. The dungeon will be split up into worlds that each introduce new mechanics and allow the player to master them.
  
+ [**Escort**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/escort/escort/)
  - **Created by:** Franklin, Gavin, Muneer, and William
  - **Description:** You are a robot babysitting the family baby when suddenly your house is raided.  Your job is to safely escort the baby out of the house and kill all the enemies.  Our game is a top down shooter where you have to travel through a house and kill enemies and protect the baby. The baby is randomly wandering around but you can push it to influence its movement.  Escort the baby safely out the house to win.
  - **Tutorial:** Move using WASD and use your mouse to aim.  Use QEF to shoot and “space” to discard your weapon and select a new one.  Upon picking your weapon, the gun will automatically shoot at your mouse. 

  
+ [**Odysseus In Underworld**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/odysseus_in_underworld/)
  - **Created by:** Dani and Manav
  - **Description:** Our game is an endless 3D running game starring Odysseus, the main character of our narrative. The player (Odysseus) is running through the Underworld while being chased by ghosts.  Odysseus will run through different parts of the Underworld, containing different terrains.  We added  facts about Odysseus and his actual trip to the Underworld to teach the player. As the player progresses Odysseus will run faster, making the pace of the game increase. There will also be more obstacles. 
	This game requires the player to master the skills of jumping. Especially as the speed of the game increases, it will be more difficult for the player to survive. The goal of the game is to return home, though it will be impossible in our game (because it is endless).

  
+ [**Parkorium**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/)
  - **Created by:** Liam
  - **Description:** For my game I designed it to sort of be a slightly challenging game in which your goal is to figure out your way to one of the Gems while discovering the mechanics on your own. I have a vaporwave type background and I tried my best to have the asset colors match said background. The main mechanics are sliding, jumping, and movement. These skills will help you get to the gem and finish the level. I tried my best to keep the design as minimalistic as possible so that there wasn't anything graphically that looks incredibly off. The game will probably take the player anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes to complete depending on their skill level. When you do get to one of the gems the game restarts including the soundtrack.
