## Session 2 Projects

+ [**Apocalypse**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/)
  - **Created by:** Mason and Justin
  - **Description:** A tower defense game in which you defend against a wave of aliens.
  
+ [**Castle Defender**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/)
  - **Created by:** Anthony and Daniel

+ [**Dungeon Puzzle**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/)
  - **Created by:** Wilbert, Jiatong, and Lucas
  - **Description:** Separated into different rooms, two wizards move in synchrony to escape a dungeon. Using their unique abilities and keen intellect, the wizards solve the increasingly difficult puzzles as they progress through the dungeon. The dungeon will be split up into worlds that each introduce new mechanics and allow the player to master them.
  
+ [**Escort**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/)
  - **Created by:** Franklin, Gavin, Muneer, and William
  - **Description:**
  
+ [**Odysseus In Underworld**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/)
  - **Created by:** Dani and Manav
  - **Description:**
  
+ [**Parkorium**](https://nyu-c4gd.github.io/nyu-c4gd/games/session2/)
  - **Created by:** Liam
  - **Description:** For my game I designed it to sort of be a slightly challenging game in which your goal is to figure out your way to one of the Gems while discovering the mechanics on your own. I have a vaporwave type background and I tried my best to have the asset colors match said background. The main mechanics are sliding, jumping, and movement. These skills will help you get to the gem and finish the level. I tried my best to keep the design as minimalistic as possible so that there wasn't anything graphically that looks incredibly off. The game will probably take the player anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes to complete depending on their skill level. When you do get to one of the gems the game restarts including the soundtrack.
